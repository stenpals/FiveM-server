Requirements
============
GTA V (v1.0.877.1 or later)
ScriptHookV

Installation
============
Put AddonSpawner.asi and the AddonSpawner folder in the main GTA V folder.

Usage
=====
Press F5 to show the menu, or enter the "addonspawner" cheat.

Add image previews:
Put a png or jpg image inside AddonSpawner/img, with the file name being the
spawn name of the vehicle. Recommended: png, 480x270. Any other aspect ratio
also works. Try keeping the file small for better performance.

User DLC Instructions
=====================
Create a `<DLC Name>.list` file with the model names you want in the DLC.
For example, if you have a few vanilla vehicles, create the following file:

VanillaWorks Lite.list

Inside the `.list` file, put each model you want on a new line, for example

streiter2
vincent2

A `VanillaWorks Lite` entry will then appear in the main menu - with under it,
the vehicles you added. Still sortable by brand or class, giving you more power
to manage your add-on vehicle packs.


Changing hotkey
===============
Change MenuKey in settings_menu.ini to something else. Available keys are
in Keyboard_Keys.txt

You can also assign a controller key combo to open the menu. 
settings_menu.ini should contain all info you need.
