# User DLC Instructions

Create a <DLC Name>.list file with the model names you want in the DLC.
For example, if you have a few vanilla vehicles, create the following file:

VanillaWorks Lite.list

Inside the .list file, put each model you want on a new line, for example

streiter2
vincent2

A `VanillaWorks Lite` entry will then appear in the main menu - with under it,
the vehicles you added. Still sortable by brand or class, giving you more power
to manage your add-on vehicle packs.
